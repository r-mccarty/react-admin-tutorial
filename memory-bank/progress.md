# Project Progress: Status and Next Steps

## What Works

- **Database Schema**: The Supabase ConfigDB schema has been successfully created based on the SQL commands in `/reference-schema`
  - All tables and views defined
  - Proper relationships established
  - Test data has been seeded

## What's Left to Build

### Core Data Provider Implementation

- [ ] Analyze existing data provider implementation
- [ ] Implement or adapt data provider for Supabase integration
- [ ] Test CRUD operations for base tables
- [ ] Configure proper filtering, sorting, and pagination

### Resource Definitions

- [ ] Items resource
- [ ] Item Variants resource
- [ ] Configuration Attributes resource
- [ ] Variant Attribute Values resource
- [ ] BOMs resource
- [ ] BOM Lines resource
- [ ] Assembly Structure resource

### View-Based Resources

- [ ] Enriched Variant Details resource (view_variant_details)
- [ ] Assembly Children Details resource (view_assembly_children_details)
- [ ] Full BOM resource (view_full_bom)

### UI Components

- [ ] Custom fields for complex data display
- [ ] Reference field implementations
- [ ] BOM visualization components
- [ ] Assembly structure visualization
- [ ] Dashboards or summary views

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] Unit tests for data provider
- [ ] Integration tests for CRUD operations
- [ ] UI testing for critical workflows
- [ ] Data validation tests

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Project Initialization
- **Focus**: Memory bank setup and baseline assessment
- **Progress**: 5% complete

The project has just been initialized with the memory bank setup. The database schema has been defined, but the React Admin implementation has not yet begun. The next phase will involve analyzing the existing codebase and implementing/enhancing the data provider to connect to Supabase.

## Known Issues

None yet, as implementation has not started. Potential challenges to anticipate:

1. **Supabase UUID Integration**: Ensuring proper handling of UUID primary keys
2. **View Resource Handling**: Determining the best approach for view-based resources that may need special handling for updates
3. **Relationship Complexity**: Managing the complex relationships between items, variants, BOMs, and assemblies
4. **Performance**: Ensuring efficient data loading for potentially large datasets

## Evolution of Project Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| April 22, 2025 | Memory bank initialized | Established project documentation for continuity |
| April 22, 2025 | Supabase schema design reviewed | The schema defined in reference-schema provides a solid foundation with proper relationships and views |

## Next Milestones

1. **Data Provider Implementation**: Complete by [TBD]
   - Implement and test connection to Supabase
   - Verify all CRUD operations
   
2. **Core Resource Implementation**: Complete by [TBD]
   - Implement the 7 base table resources
   - Test their functionality
   
3. **View Resource Implementation**: Complete by [TBD]
   - Implement resources based on database views
   - Determine read/write strategy

4. **UI Refinement**: Complete by [TBD]
   - Enhance UI for better usability
   - Implement specialized visualization components

## Blockers and Dependencies

No current blockers. Dependencies include:

- Access to a working Supabase instance with the ConfigDB schema
- React Admin version compatibility with chosen approaches
- TypeScript type definitions for the database schema
